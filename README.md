RecipeApp
RecipeApp is a command-line application developed in C# that allows users to enter, display, scale, and manage recipes. Users can enter details for a single recipe, including ingredients and cooking steps, and perform various operations such as scaling the recipe quantities and clearing the data.

Features
- Enter Recipe Details: Users can enter the details for a single recipe, including the number of ingredients, names, quantities, and units of measurement for each ingredient, as well as the number of cooking steps and descriptions for each step.
- Display Recipe: Users can view the full recipe, including the ingredients and cooking steps, in a neat format.
- Scale Recipe: Users can request to scale the recipe by a factor of 0.5 (half), 2 (double), or 3 (triple). All ingredient quantities are adjusted accordingly when the recipe is displayed.
- Reset Quantities: Users can reset the ingredient quantities to their original values.
- Clear All Data: Users can clear all entered data to enter a new recipe. The data is stored in memory and is not persisted between runs.
